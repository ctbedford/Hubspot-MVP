Their primary goal is raising awareness and our agency is responsible for activating media on The Trade Desk for Digital Display and OLV (Online Video), but they will also have other channels in market like YouTube, Google Search, Meta, TikTok, Peacock and others.  I am not extremely with Pathformance but it has been brought to my attention by the client and another colleague.  From my understanding, you can run market lift/sales lift studies with the need to tag media and you have partnerships with NCS and others to get retailer sales data.  Does Pathformance have a brand awareness measurement solution that can survery for awareness, recall, consideration or purchase intent? I am assuming that type of solution may require tagging media.

How many SKUs can we feature? We’re looking to promote priority SKUs available at these retail stores. This would be a full portfolio campaign but I am guessing we would only measure a certain amount of hero products and the rest could be considered halo for the measurement study.. 
Let us know your recommendation for this campaign, based on the information provided.

They will be in-store on incremental display for 3 weeks and our objective is to move all the product within that timeframe to unlock a larger partnership with Aldi moving forward.
Objective: Increase sales for Sparkling Ice Energy during key promotional windows through disruptive awareness driving ads.
Aldi Find In-Market Timing: 4/16 – 5/7 (3w)
Retailers: Aldi (priority), Buccee’s (secondary – let’s run a plan with and without Buccee’s included)
Full chain at Aldi - 2,300 stores. Need to sell through 24,500 cases (12pks sold as SS SKUs)
We will also be pushing Energy live at Food Lion in early June and may be interested in pulsing support then. We don’t need to work through details now but wanted to put this on your radar in case there’s efficiency in turning it on for Aldi and Buccee’s then pausing and turning back on for Buccee’s and Food Lion.
Listing retail: $1.79 MSRP at Aldi

Molson Coors wants to run a campaign for Coors Light (Halo read) during march madness (campaign aligns with that timeframe). I have selected stores in three banners, Jewel, Safeway, and Albertsons. Left plenty out for control in each division (at least 50%). 

Will attach the store list, can you please let me know if this is feasible? Thanks!

Brand/Products: Del Monte Pears and Peaches & BelGioioso Burrata and Mozzarella
Timing: 5/1/25 - 6/30/25

Looking for feasibility based on each retailer. We are presenting a menu of options to the client, so would want to understand if each retailer will achieve at least a $4 minimum iROAS

option 2: Target ($50K / brand, $100K total) = 9,523,810 total impressions
option 3: Publix ($50K / brand, $100K total) = 9,523,810 total impressions
option 4: Instacart (xaoc) ($50K / brand, $100K total) = 9,523,810 total impressions
Retailers: see above
Client-Driven Goals: Incremental Sales (Dollars)
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control

Details below. Could you let us know your initial thoughts and recommendations?

White Claw wants to give a big push for their rebrand of the Zero Proof White Claw (formerly known as 0%) with a campaign driving sales lift. Knowing that their Zero Proof product has only been in market a short while, we wanted to first check to make sure a sales lift study would be feasible.

Est. Budget: $250K
Impressions: ~45M
Store List: TBD, but likely nationwide liquor stores and C-stores
Flight Dates: 4/15-6/8/25, 10/1-10/31, 1/1-1/31/26
Ideally, we would also like to break up the sales lift into multiple studies, either for each flight individually or grouping 10/1-10/31 and 1/1-1/31/26 separately from the 4/15-6/8 flight but let us know if that is at all doable.

Flight Dates: 4/15-6/8/25, 10/1-10/31, 1/1-1/31/26

do you have a best practice on how long you like to see sales in-market with relatively newer products? Are there any workarounds from having to do hero/halo?
 
Also – this campaign would be run in the below market list:
Chicago, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Denver, Columbus, Portland, Milwaukee, Miami, San Diego, Seattle, Louisville, Virgina Beach, Austin, Las Vegas, Omaha, Charlotte, Grand Rapids, Pittsburgh","White Claw Zero Proof","","0.3","33.0","Response Sent","","","","12500.0","","","Drive Sales","","45000000","0.0","false","false","false","1.0","","","2025-05-21 22:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","IMPORT","2024 Completed Projects in Monday .xlsx","2024-12-19 12:38","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","IMPORT","2024 Completed Projects in Monday .xlsx","","2GJTK6A","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2089:15:46","","","3750.0","3750.0"

Additional info: 
Would it be possible to measure Dairy category with different flights within a 12 week timeframe. for example:
4 weeks - support Greek Yogurt $16.6K budget
4 weeks - support Milk $16.6K budget
4 weeks - support Cheese $16.6K budget
Total of $50K budget within 12 weeks, but measure different products? Is this feasible for Idaho and Utah?

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Too Good Zero Sugar Yogurt campaign. 
This is a new product launch so there will not be any data for the Too Good Zero Sugar product at Whole foods yet. It will be cut in in February. Even though we won't be able to get feasibility yet I want to get it on your radar/within their list as a submitted campaign since we would like to include Pathformance measurement even though it is a new product launch!

I've been working with Jesse, yet as he's on PTO, hoping someone on the team can assist me with the request below.  
Apologies for the quick turnaround, but the brand has asked from this by EOD PST Thurs.  Is that possible?  We'd love to partner with Pathformance again for measurement.


Health-Ade is launching 2 new flavors.  Below is the brief. 
Target Audience: Anyone seen in Whole Foods 520 stores in the last 3 months 
Geo: US National focus
Flight Date: 3 months, Launch Feb 15 (after Valentines Day) through May 15th 
Omnichannel: CTV, DOOH, Mobile, Desktop & Audio
*We may only be supporting Mobile +DOOH (TBD)
Creative: Assets provided by Health-Ade (note* Locala offers any digital asset creation as AV to any campaign partnership.  I'll include a few examples of our units that we use when the goal is driving in-store foot traffic to purchase)
KPI: Increase sales lift.
Budget: TBD, $75K, $150K or $250K
Insights: SKU (do other brands see impact or just 2 new flavors) , Regional and Distributor level to determine the ROAS on the investment along with any ripple impact on the brand overall
Can you run a feasibility test on this by EOD Thurs PST and confirm: 
What the expected ROAS is 
How feasible this is
Any other amazing insights you advise to set expectations with a new partnership

Feel free to call me if you want to discuss this further.  I am on PST, yet availabe at your connivence.  

When you email back details, can you also include my sales partner, King:
king.sovanna@asklocala.com

Are we able to run the 2 flights listed above? Ideally, the client would want to be able to get a mid campaign read vs. waiting until May for a full campaign report. Let me know if this would be better to run as 2 separate measurement studies. Thank you!

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below DFA Garelick Cottage Cheese_Dec-Feb 2025 campaign. 

Parent Company: DFA Garelick
Brand/Products: Halo: Garelick Cottage Cheese & Sour Cream
Timing: Timing: ~12 weeks (Dec-Feb)
Budget: $100K
Impressions: 9.7M
Retailers: Stop & Shop
Client-Driven Goals: iROAS & Lift are important - Do you see this projecting to hit 1:1 by measuring cottage cheese + sour cream UPCs only? IF NOT, what will get us to a 1:1 (including total brand as halo, increasing campaign length, etc).

Please CC ella@chicory.co on your response.

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Primal Kitchen campaign. Please see below for a few nuances for this request. 
1. We would like to set this up as a 3-panel test: Premium vs Premium + new ad product vs control
2. Primal Kitchen would supply geo-level Amazon data for this campaign, just like they did for our January 2024 Collagen campaign
3. Is Pathformance able to refer to last year's data that PK supplied to confirm if a 3-panel setup would be feasible? And is there a specific number of impressions they'd recommend per panel?

Parent Company: Primal Kitchen
Brand/Products: Primal Kitchen Collagen Peptides
Timing: 1/1/25 - 2/28/25
Budget: $75K, $100K
Impressions: TBD (Open to suggestions for impressions per panel) 
Retailers: Amazon

Please CC jenna@chicory.co on your response.

Hi Team, 
We think this is a good opp for an xAOC grocery study with Pathformance considering all the retailers listed in the attachment.  Can you check and let us know out of the 5 months they want to run, what is the longest flighting they suggest for the sales study?

Can you also let us know what retailers they cannot measure in the xAOC study?  

This is focusing on a few SKUs – Kombucha, Sparkling Refreshers, Lemonades
Or if they suggest another study. 

 Thank you.","1H Kevita","","0.3","","Response Sent","","","","10000.0","","","Drive Sales","","7150000.0","0.0","false","false","false","1.0","2025-03-19 14:17","2025-03-19 14:17","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","144:19:35","","","","","","","","","","52:04:17","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2024-05-20 15:52","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","M87GGP9","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","1892:45:51","","","3000.0","3000.0"

*Ignore drop down fields*

Reaching out to see if you can help with a recommended budget for an always-on 2025 campaign for Vital Farms Butter. This would be a year-long program where we are present during the full year and just pulse heavier impressions during key seasonal periods. Any reco on the full year budget, which time periods should be heavier, and how much we should ""heavy up"" would be helpful! The brand's 2025 KPI is going to new HHs/buyers/new to brand.

It came in as a rush, basically approved from the start. They already shared the attached data, so would it be possible to quickly review the attached and confirm if this includes everything you would need to quickly build out the test/control?

This is another C&D one where they have technically only contracted Q3 but plan to extend through Q4 once funds are released and we would only need one read covering the full timeframe (launch ASAP - 11/30).

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Truvia campaign. The client needs a positive ROAS. Timing is slightly flexible, if needed - meaning we could extend. Looking to understand from Pathformance which retailer mix they would recommend to achieve 1x+ iROAS.

Parent Company: Cargill
Brand/Products: Truvia's Portfolio of Products
Timing: 1/1/25 - 2/28/25 (flexible to extend)
Budget: $50,000
Impressions: 4,608,295 
Retailers: looking for recommendation
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control 

Please CC jaclyn@chicory.co on your response.

Can you confirm the ability to report on sales that happen instore vs. online? Any limitations on the level of granularity for this reporting?
Can we report out on specific skus? (ex. pads vs. liners) Any limitations on the level of granularity for this reporting?
Do you have the ability to report if someone has bought liners and then pads throughout the course of the campaign?
Are you able to report out on performance metrics (ROAS, dollars sales, and units sold) Any limitations on the level of granularity for this reporting?

Kellanova is launching a new item called Pringles Mingles. This will be in a new package like a traditional chip bag and is their big bet for increasing their base business. 

They are using in-store tactics to promote this new product launch as the hero product but also are open to a halo read. I will upload a UPC list as well as a tentative store list we are looking to run in. 

Are we able to show a lift study for the halo products and provide post campaign insights for the newer product?

For Q4, the strategy will be similar to the Q2-Q3 plan, aiming to drive velocity and help deplete old packs.

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Bigelow Butterfly Pea Flower Tea campaign. The client will provide their Walmart data for this campaign. However, because this is a new item, in only about 1600 Walmart stores and will not be on shelves until September, I am curious of the following questions
1. when would pathformance advise starting the campaign if product won't be on shelf until Sept?
2. based on this product category, does pathformance recommend a shorter or longer campaign timeframe ( 8 weeks vs. 14 weeks).

 - However client is considering adding Target + Grocery (tbd on exact retailers but thinking Kroger, ABSCO, ADUSA). 

Additionally, the clients are concerned the September end date is outside of the outdoor season and would prefer to focus on July/August if you think that works for the $195K budget. If we keep the 9/30 end date, we will look to switch assets in September supporting their sustainable swaps messaging instead which highlights other uses of baking soda that can be used indoor within the home. Can you please let us know the implications of having 2 separate messaging in the same campaign, e.g., impacts to studies etc. and if we’d recommend just shortening the flight?","AHBS Pool & Outdoor Living","","1.0","","Closed Won Finalized","","","","17500.0","","","Drive Sales","","19000000","1.0","false","true","true","0.0","","","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","2024-12-13 18:02","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","","7EAZWSB","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2089:03:04","","","17500.0","17500.0"

I will also follow up via email. Here are the seller's notes - 

What retailer(s) are we wanting to do a sales lift study at? Costco
CPG Brand and parent company if applicable: Silk Organic Almondmilk, parent company = Danone
National targeting, or specific states? National
What platforms would campaigns run on? TikTok and Meta
UPC codes/SKUs or product links: Costco doesn't have a good eComm site and I don't have the UPC code. Here's the brand landing page where the product packaging is shown though! This is the SAME featured product we measured in last year's campaign with them
Brand page: https://www.costco.com/silk-brand-showcase.html
What dates would the campaign run? 8/12/2024 - 10/31/2024
What is the campaign’s paid media budget in PAYOUT? $62,634
Estimated impressions between all optimizations? ~13M
Additional Question:
Confirming Pathformance would have no issue measuring DOOH media too? If we do DOOH media on top of influencer, confirm it will not corrupt results if we can follow same geo-targeting guidelines?","Silk Bee Better at Costco 2024 by Danone - TPN","","1.0","","Closed Won Finalized","","","","9794.0","","","Drive Sales","","13000000","1.0","false","true","true","0.0","","","2025-04-28 19:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2024-03-05 14:33","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","IS4MBG4","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2089:02:45","","","9794.0","9794.0"

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Herdez Entrees Summer Campaign. We just received confirmation on an incremental campaign to support Herdez Entrees. Being that the previous Herdez Entrees campaign has already ended, we will be setting up new measurement studies for this upcoming campaign. It may be helpful to note that this campaign will look almost identical to the Herdez Entrees Walmart campaign that Pathformance measured with the Path ID IW7PT7H

The brand is currently in distribution at regional and independent retailers but needs the business to shift to larger retailers for longer-term sustainability. Despite being in the marketplace for some time, Chairman’s Reserve still lacks meaningful brand/product awareness.  To help Chairman’s Reserve solidify distribution at current retailers and build a strong case for expansion to new, larger retailers, it will be essential to amplify velocity by quickly building awareness, interest, and most importantly, trial.  

The desired priority retailers are Wakefern (ShopRite/Fresh Grocer), Rouses, and Times Supermarket. There is no drop-down for Times (24 stores in Hawaii) and Fresh Grocer (13 stores in Philly). We might need to run a Food Channel sales lift analysis against these retailers' footprints? Do we exclude Times?

We need this campaign to perform well to get the bigger retailer activations with bigger Tyson brands.","Tyson's Chairman's Reserve Beef & Pork - Summer '24 Retailer Activation","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","10500000","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","2024-05-31 14:00","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","","EXT7R8F","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2089:02:05","","","",""

Targeting = A18-34 Coffee Drinkers with Social, Trendy, Indulgent, and Active passion points
Brands / SKUs to Measure = Let's check TAZO Black Tea and Total TAZO Tea please

This is not targeted to specific retailers, so I selected xAOC.  If you think others make more sense, let me know.

Unsure if this is a full portfolio campaign, or just black tea ... can we look into both options?

Similarly - no specific Geo targeting ... it's a national campaign.  Let me know if there are specific geos you'd recommend going dark in to allow for measurement.

Finally - as usual, the goal here is positive sales lift, and positive ROAS.  If there are other retailers that are necessary to include in order to drive a > $1 ROAS, please let me know.","TAZO Summer Campaign","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","22000000","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 22:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2023-10-27 15:05","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","62LPDES","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2089:01:57","","","",""

And walnuts can make your summer meals more delicious. 


Timing
May 20th - August 31st 2024

Geography
Same 12 markets that we were used for the holiday campaign. (Market list reattached for reference.) 

Targeting
The target audience is: W25-49, health minded home cooks, walnut buyers and nut buyers. If there is any other targeting that you think would be relevant based on the goal of the campaign let us know. 

Placements
We would like to utilize the Moments in-store and in-hand and the preceptivity/audiences pre-shop tactics for this campaign. 

Budget
$100,000

Pathformance Units Measurement Study
We want to include a Pathformance Measurement study as part of the campaign and we want the primary focus of the measurement to be on measuring units sold. We know from talking to Pathformance that their studies need to focus on either units or sales and in this case units are more of a priority for CA Walnuts.","CA Walnuts x InMarket","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","7142857.0","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2023-12-11 20:00","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","3JAO9QY","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:58:39","","","",""

Hope all is well - we have an RFP for Bacardi that I'd like to scope feasibility for.

Full campaign details are unknown (i.e. size / impressions / etc), but here is what we do know:

Flight Dates:  looks like two flights, 5/17-7/12, and 11/15-12/31
Targeting: National
Retailers:  All outlets
Brands:  this is a full portfolio plan, so all of the below products will be advertised (we're assuming multiple brands featured within the creatives)
Patron
Bacardi
Grey Goose
Angel's Envy
Bombay
D'Usse
Dewar's
Cazadores
St. Germain

The $300k budget is split equally - $150k each - into each of the flights listed above.

So, my questions are:
How many impressions would we need in order to get a read across all of these brands in aggregate?
Can we provide a read on each brand?

Would you treat this as a single study or multiple studies?  What would you recommend?

Anything else we should consider?

Please review, and let me know if you have any questions / comments.  If there are specific retailers and / or markets that you would recommend being live / dark in please let me know.

Sincerely,

JT","Teads x Bacardi Portfolio - Summer/Holiday 2024","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","1.0","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 22:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2023-10-27 15:05","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","6B6TOFC","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:57:12","","","",""

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Molson Coors Light 2024 campaign. Please see retailer question below!

Parent Company: Molson Coors

Retailers: xAOC - Have you ever ever measured Drizly/Uber Eats using xAOC for BevAlc? It would be $50k or $100k per quarter. We'd want to measure Q2, Q3, Q4 as separate campaigns. Can you also confirm how many markets we can cover w/ the $50k quarterly budget vs $100k quarterly budget?

Please CC lindsay@chicory.co on your response.

Mira Loma, CA
Houston, TX
Dallas,TX
Chicago, IL
Tracy, CA
Tampa, FL
Miami, FL
Fort Lauderdale, FL
Indianapolis, IN
San Diego, CA
Miami Beach, FL

So, my questions are:
How many impressions would we need in order to get a read on Angel's Envy sales lift over these 2 flights?
Would you treat this as a single study or multiple studies?  What would you recommend?
How can we achieve both sales lift and positive ROAS here?

We look to your reco for retailers to use, etc ... no indication from the brand on specific retailers in mind for this campaign OR if they have POS data.","Teads Angel's Envy Q2-Q4 2024","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","1.0","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 22:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2023-10-27 15:05","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","5SQ8EYV","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:56:38","","","",""

Since both campaigns are running 4/1 - 6/30, can we have feasibility for an xAOC study across both campaigns? 

Looking to include these products attached in our Sales lift study for HVR Base. Thinking we have a sales lift for Innovation products and sales lift across the entire brand. Can we potentially report out Innovation or certain product lines within the results?

HVR Innovation Products across Dipping, Seasoning and Dressings including Inverted Bottle Flavors, Ranch Nights Seasoning Packets and Dressing Flavors. See attached for UPC list and below for product priorities.

-Dipping Set: Garlic / Inverted Flavors: Garlic is a new launch, Pickle and Buffalo are existing
-Spicy: Jalapeño, Hot Honey, Nashville Hot (Walmart Exclusive): New Product launches at Walmart only 
-Cheezy Ranch (Walmart & Kroger): New product launch; partnership with Cheez-It
-Ranch Nights: Seasoning Mixes Set: Ranch Recipes, Existing products with new positioning, Want to focus on recipe inspiration 
-Dressing Set: Parmesan, New flavor launch – don’t have the UPC yet

They are looking for our assistance on the best ways they can support all of HVR's new flavors and the portfolio of products across dipping, dressings and seasonings. If needed, we can also look to focus on just the top 3 priority products / flavors listed above.

Campaign Background: The Spring / Summer timeframe is a key time of year that offers opportunity to pair products across the HVR portfolio with key host foods that are traditionally featured at grilling and outdoor eating events. Commerce marketing should drive awareness and trial of the HVR portfolio across key pulse periods, with a focus on Bottled & Dry or the role they play in outdoor grilling events.

Objective:  Drive consideration and trial of HVR products in-store and online during key Spring & Summer Grilling pulse periods among new and lapsed buyers.","Hidden Valley Ranch Base '24","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","11943864","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","2024-09-25 15:08","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","","EXW48X7","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:56:33","","","",""

Brand/Products: new Lunchables Dunkables items
Timing: 12 weeks (4/1/24 - 6/24)
Budget: $50K
Impressions: 3.3MM
Retailers: Hannaford
Client-Driven Goals: Sales Lift;Incremental Sales (Dollars)
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control
**Client is looking to drive immediate sales of new Lunchables Dunkables items at Hannaford. We talked about sales lift being the main KPI here, but can Pathformance look into an estimated sales lift/incremental sales for us for Scenario #1? 
Scenario #2 can be that we use Lunchables Dunkables as our hero skus and the remaining Lunchables items as a halo. How does this impact our lift/incremental sales?

Campaign Background:  Early season: Help drive shopper inspiration to grill with charcoal during moments they are already gathering but may not have grilling top of mind.

 Peak Season: Get shoppers to choose Kingsford during holidays where grilling is already top of mind. Lapsed buyers are a big opportunity due to the longer purchase cycle and stock up behavior among charcoal grillers (particularly among intermediate/advanced grillers who are using multiple grill and fuel types)

Campaign Objective:  Drive conversion by inspiring +1 grilling occasion among existing and lapsed charcoal buyers

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Smithfield Q2 Campaign:

Parent Company: Smithfield
Brand/Products: Smithfield brand - bacon, anytime favorites, marinated pork, prime fresh deli
Timing: 3/31/24 - 6/30/24
Budget:$138K
Impressions: 12,545,456
Retailers: xAOC
Client-Driven Goals: Incremental Sales (Dollars);ROAS
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control
Notes: We will be supporting the above 4 products/product lines with differing geographies for each - what we communicated to the client: For sales insights, all of the markets we support with media will be considered test markets, while we will hold out media from a group of control markets. The test markets will combine and include the markets you included in the spreadsheet (if we can't include all in order to build a sufficient control, it will still be the majority). We will turn back incremental sales, sales lift and iROAS for the entire test group which will span all of your categories/UPCs. We will also show these metrics at the UPC level and can then group by bacon, ATF, mar pork and prime fresh.

Goal: Drive in-store/online consideration/conversion of the thematic Luke Combs pack at Walmart. Capitalize on the market buzz surrounding Luke Combs concerts and heavy-up in the markets surrounding his tour dates.

Heavy up in the markets where he’s touring two weeks in advance of concert. (I will follow up with a store list and concert tour to show when we will heavy up).

Is this feasible for measurement for the thematic packs? Are there any issues with the flight length?

The client is able to provide walmart POS data!","Miller Lite Luke Combs - AdAdapted","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","15625000","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","2024-05-10 12:31","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","","2WVIO2E","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:54:50","","","",""

We are launching an Easter wave for Kingsford on 2/13, immediately following the end of our Super Bowl campaign. This is a unique situation, as these two campaigns are both targeting similar keywords/recipes and serving Walmart markets. This second wave includes different UPCs from the first wave, so we'd ideally like distribution to drive the TvCs. That said, we'd love to hear your recommendation on this, as there are other factors to consider, such as the 2 week post-period. 

Please let us know your thoughts here, and if you'd recommend building new TvCs or if we should continue using the same markets as the current wave. 

Additionally, please find the new Intake Form attached here, outlining all of the campaign details and UPCs.","Kingsford Easter","","1.0","","Closed Won Finalized","","","","4545.0","","","Drive Sales","","3954619.0","1.0","false","true","true","0.0","","","2025-05-29 10:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","CRM_UI","Deactivated user","2023-09-06 13:43","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","CRM_UI","Deactivated user","","20W0IYM","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:54:37","","","4545.0","4545.0"

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Eggland's Best LOL 2H campaign. We ran a BJs/Ahold measurement study with Pathformance for Land O Lakes in 2023. We want to repeat this campaign with a couple of changes. We are looking to complete two completely different measurement studies for the two flights.

Parent Company: Eggland's Best
Brand/Products: Will be similar to campaign we ran in 2023 for Land O Lakes
Timing: Flight 1: Aug 15 - Sept 15
Flight 2: Nov 15 - Dec 25
Budget: $120K (Flight 1: $15K BJ's, $40K Ahold; Flight 2: $20K BJ's, $45K Ahold)
Impressions: Flight 1: 1.5MM BJ's, 4MM Ahold; Flight 2: 2MM BJ's, 4.5MM Ahold
Retailers: BJ's and Ahold

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Campbell's & Good Foods Co-Branded Cinco campaign. Please see the retailer note below.

Parent Company: Campbell's & Good Foods
Brand/Products: Late July tortilla chips, Good Foods guacamole
Timing: 4/1/24 - 5/8/24
Budget: $50K

Retailers: Sprouts - Late July confirmed they do not have access to Sprouts store-level data (we're awaiting confirmation if they have market/regional-level data or just total level). We're still awaiting confirmation if Good Foods has store-level data. If they do not, would it be possible to do a matched-market analysis at the Food channel level, focusing the test and control markets where there's a high concentration of Sprouts stores?

We'd like your recommendation on which 3 retailers to measure. We will also have a Kroger campaign running in ALL Kroger and Kroger division markets during this time, measured by 84.51. There is no control, because the study is attribution.

See below for more details!
 
Brand/Product: Pine-Sol (see attached UPC list)

Campaign Background: To drive innovation, the Pine-Sol products will be getting even more concentrated in 2024. The Brand is leaning into sustainability (less liquid/smaller bottles) by compacting the product to be 2X the concentrated formula with 5x the cleaning action. We also want to grow HHP by sourcing from key competitors.

New concentrated formula is launching nationally on 4/1

Since this is a new formula, I'm not sure if sales lift is feasible but wanted to see our options. I attached the UPC list they provided. This RFP is due on Friday so any information you could provide before that would be great!","Pine Sol '24","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","11326562","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","2024-09-25 15:08","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","","GL0O7GY","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:51:06","","","",""

•	Increase retail sales for Clubtails by increasing awareness and driving trial

Geloso views their competition from the lens of competing for shelf space and share of distribution while consumer markets show significant overlap within non-traditional alcohol categories (i.e all non-beer, wine or spirits).
•	Direct competitors are Mike’s Harder, Simrnoff  Smash, Pirate Water, Seagram’s Escapes and other high abv flavored malt beverages
•	Indirect competitors/competitors within consumer space include White Claw, Truly, High Noon, Mike’s Hard, Smirnoff Ice
•	We expect additional saturation in the market and can leverage the internal BT Edge dashboard to monitor competitive spend
•	Multiple indirect competitors have entered the market in 2023 with brands like Dunkin, Sunny D, and others releasing hard versions of their products
•	Geloso views their competitive set as high alc FMBs as opposed to the larger non-beer/wine beverage space

They can provide sales data  for both retailers.  Would they be feasible for a sales study?  Happy to fill out the form but wanted to see if even worth considering with $45K for Starry and only media on Tuesdays at PFJ.","Pepsico / Starry at RaceTrac and Mtn Dew at Pilot Flying J","","1.0","","Closed Won Finalized","","","","3150.0","","","Drive Sales","","1600000.0","1.0","false","true","true","0.0","","","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2024-05-20 15:52","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","DORCX01","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:50:13","","","3150.0","3150.0"

Audience: The C-Store shopper is driven by impulse purchases that bring them joy. The C-Store shopper is generally a low to medium income household member. 77% would describe themselves as avid or average sports fans. They rarely look at nutrition labels, and do not follow any special diets at home. They are mostly looking for a fun and delicious savory snack to enjoy at home solo or with friends less so than eating on the go.

We are focusing on impulse shoppers who are looking to fulfill hunger when they are close the C-Store convenience store point of purchase.

Campaign Background: Glad ForceFlex MaxStrength line of Kitchen trash bags was formerly Glad ForceFlex Plus. Strength is a foundational benefit in the trash category, and the Glad brand transitioned the name to MaxStrength in Spring 2023. In addition to the name change, the product claim of 25% more durable was emphasized. The product improvement/packaging transition received significant marketing support.

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Unilever Maille Holiday campaign. The client is putting heavy emphasis on ROAS, so could you please confirm for both retailer options below?

Budget: $150,350
Impressions: 15,035,000
Retailers: xAOC or could be retail specific for all but walmart (Stop & Shop, Hannaford, ABSCO, Publix). Can we group Hannaford & stop&shop together and therefore constitute it as one under “Ahold”?
We want to confirm each option along with ROAS and then show both to Unilever

Ruiz Foods is looking to prove that media can drive sales and business results, through a limited-run campaign to take us through toward the end of Q4. The goal is drive the most effective ROAS possible within the plan parameters in a limited selection of markets.

A key consideration in this will be a limited R/F test running over the top of this campaign; we will divide the markets into two groups with varying budget levels to test the performance of high versus low frequency and the effect that has on ROAS. We are awaiting direction from the client team on which markets will fall into which group, but want to prepare you to divide the budget in half to test the performance at varying levels.

Geographies include (DMAs):
Dallas/Ft. Worth
Phoenix/Tuscon
Kansas City
Oklahoma City
Denver
Tulsa
Sacramento
Charlotte
Cleveland
Green Bay
Milwaukee

Parent Company: Remy Cointreau
Brand/Products: Total Cointreau Line
Timing: 11/6/23- 1/2/24
Budget: $57K

Retailers: We are likely going to measure Total Wine and then xAOC on the market level. The client is looking for a recommendation on which markets for this investment to deploy media based on retailer priority:
- Total Wine
- ABSCO banners
- Costco (they could share the data with us possibly)
- Kroger
- Walmart
- Publix (being lowest priority)
If there are recommended markets for this brand that we see sales in a different retailer we would also include any additions.

We (jenn and Erin) over at inMarket are working on a new client - 8 oclock coffee, with resolution agency. (Its the same agency that runs Sanderson Farms). They just won the business and inMarket has been RFPd for their initial test plans. this one is a little tricky because they have identified 5 test markets where they plan to run media.

Narrowed plan to 5 DMAs: Boston, Chicago, Miami, New York, and Washington DC

within these test markets, 8 o'clock coffee is sold in the following retailers
Priority retailers: Walmart, Kroger, Publix, Shoprite, Meijer, Food Lion

We have been tasked with recommending two plan options and want to get your POV.

OPTION 1) run in all 5 markets, all retailers (use a non media market as control) and then see if we can measure either a Total channel read (mass and grocery) or just grocery. would love your POV on if this is possible. 

or OPTION 2). Pick 1-2 markets, and try to measure only 1-2 retailers, like a meijer or a publix. i think this might be way too small or restrictive.

Primarily just looking to give the client some guidance on how to structure. thank you as always for your recommendation and partnership!","inMarket_8 O'Clock Coffee_Regional Activation_Multi Retail & New inMarket Client Test Campaign","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","7500000.0","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2024-03-04 14:23","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","9LRQM27","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:45:50","","","",""

Campaign Dates: 9/16-10/31 @ Whole Foods
Markets: NY, Boston, Atlanta, Denver

I think we can focus media on the events in market then expand to DMAs or states as you'll see the client outlined below:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Would it help to align the in-store Moments with the event window rather than a set date for all of 10/1? So, it could look something like this:

NYC + Boston Sept 15-Sept 23, then open up Moments to the entire DMA or TriState+MA area (see notes on store list below)
Atlanta + Denver Sept 15-30, then open up Moments to the entire DMA or states of GA and CO (see notes on store list below)
I experimented with a couple of options RE: store list. Could one of these work for a study with a “smaller grouping of stores?”

Extend the store list to the entire DMA of the four event locations: 91 stores
See NY, Boston, Atlanta, and Denver tabs in the attached

Can you please pull the pre-salers report and any other sales data to help us guide the client to make a decision on which retailers to support and what markets to support.
Any data you can provide would be helpful. If it's easy can you all share this for volume sales as well.

Can you please pull the pre-salers report and any other sales data to help us guide the client to make a decision on which retailers to support and what markets to support.
Any data you can provide would be helpful. If it's easy can you all share this for volume sales as well.

Parent Company: Mrs. T's Pierogies
Brand/Products: Mrs. T's Pierogies
Timing: 9/1/23 - 11/30/23 would you suggest a shorter flight based on budget?
Budget: $44,500 - let us know if we would need to increase this budget in order to have feasible measurement and if so, how much?

Reaching out to confirm feasibility for the below National Mango Board Campaign. We're looking to understand measurement options for the commodity board that we support: fresh mango. I'm not sure if we have a way to measure this type of campaign based on PLU data since there are no UPCs to pass over. The board does NOT want to include any frozen mangos.

Parent Company: National Mango Board
Brand/Products: Commodity Board - Mangos (Fresh Mangos)
Timing: TBD
Budget: $50K
Impressions: 4,484,305
Retailers: xAOC or food channel read, just overall any retailer coverage
Client-Driven Goals: Sales Lift, Incremental Sales (Dollars), ROAS
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control

They have one brand, Iron Flask that we can use for our pitch example. 

It is sold online as well as in Target and Walmart, see below. 

They compete against other stainless steel water bottles like Contigo, Yeti, Hydroflask, Ello and more. 

Can we please get a digital shelf analysis:

Share of Shelf/how many skus vs competitor at both WM and Target
Distribution, how many stores for both WM / Target they are in
Keyword Search/Sponsorship 
Opportunities where they can win (other keywords they should be using, etc)
Anything else you can provide that shows insights for the brand from our digital shelf perspective. 
https://www.walmart.com/search?q=iron+flask
https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=iron+flast

I owe a follow up to my contact by Tuesday next week. Can you please put together this for us by then? Screenshots will work and just an email back on the above topics will work for me. 

If helpful, you could set me / Tamara up with a dev site with this brand and keywords/competitors that we could go to and we can do the analysis ourselves. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you!

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Meati Q4 Holiday Program

Parent Company: Meati
Brand/Products: Meati Portfolio: Chicken, Carne Asada, Classic Steak
Timing: 11/1/23 - 12/26/23
Budget: $50K and $80K
Impressions: $50K at 4,545,454 impressions and $80K at 7,272,727 impressions
Retailers: Meijer, Sprouts, Whole Foods
Client-Driven Goals: Sales Lift, ROAS
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control
Additional Notes: Meijer, Sprouts, Whole Foods and/or Fresh Thyme - which 3 would the Pathformance team recommend? We're seeing Pathformance has data for Whole Foods and Meijer and the client could supply data for Sprouts. Does Pathformance have Fresh Thyme data?

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Roth Cheese 2H 2023 Campaign.

Parent Company: Emmi Roth
Brand/Products: Roth Cheese portfolio (Gouda, Havarti, Blue Cheese, Fontina, Canela, etc. 
Timing: 10/1/23 - 12/31/23
Budget: $50K
Impressions: 4,484,305 impressions to be served from 9/1/23 - 12/31/23
Retailers: ABS Jewel, Coborn's, Fresh Thyme, Hy-Vee, KR Roundy's, Meijer, and Piggly Wiggly
Markets: all WI major DMAs (Green Bay/Appleton/Oshkosh, Milwaukee/Waukesha, Racine/Kenosha, Madison, Janesville, Eau Claire) + Chicago
Client-Driven Goals: Sales Lift;Incremental Sales (Dollars);ROAS

Looking for your team's guidance on the total flight duration with respect to the impressions (i.e. should we only run 10/1/23-12/31/23 to get better results?). The client is interested in ""heavying up"" on impressions during Oct-December, around holiday timing, but we could certainly recommend a heavy up during November and December only if your team recommends only supporting 10/1-12/31. Additionally, is there another measurement option outside of Food Channel that we could/should consider for this campaign, since it's only regional.

Campaign Background: We are developing an annual plan to support Nonni's Bakery (Biscotti, THINaddictives, La Dolce Vita) at Costco. Given recent price-increase pressures, the brand is down 6.65% YTD vs. YAG. Food, overall, is doing well at Costco, and Nonni’s isn’t gaining their fair share. We are looking to support the portfolio of products in Costco 2-3 times per year. They currently have 3 products in distribution - Biscotti and THINaddictives, and La Dolce Vita (a Costco exclusive).

Retailers: Costco (All Divisions)

LA, San Diego, Texas​
Bay Area --> This is a priority market for Biscotti, but this is not a priority or suitable for THINaddictives. Northeast is replacement. ​
Aisle it’s located in the store: D12 / Grocery - Cookies and Snacks (In D12, single-serve food types are trending up. Bars, Chips/Snacks, Meat Snacks, Single-serve salads).
Based on budgets, it’s likely a regional focus for each brand will help flights extend further, however for Biscotti, we will have 2 budget tiers in which a national play (anchored by the rotating store list) can be considered.","Nonni's Biscotti at Costco '23","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","9496445.0","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","2024-09-25 15:08","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","","F6UDT9W","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:42:17","","","",""

Think this will be xAOC measurement, but info I have on stores & KPIs for In-store/eComm are below: 
Please see below from the RFP.
Shopper Marketing 
Primary: Strategic Accounts with Stores by State in legal WTB Markets 

Recommendation: CA, IL, FL, WA, MO, LA, NV, WI, TX, IA, NM. (Open to PHD feedback if this list needs to expand or be narrowed down further to reflect top states)

Note-OH, AZ, IN, MI, KY are also key strategic Accounts states, but only compliant to list marketplaces. If there is an in-store component (Ie inMarket moments etc.) can include these states for that activity only. 

Key Retailers: TBA
E-Commerce: 
Focus should be on Strategic Account eComm Markets (AZ, CA, IL, FL, TX, NV, LA, WI, NM, NV) and independents via marketplaces (Drizly, Minibar, Saucey etc).   Big independent eComm markets covered by marketplaces include: NJ, NY, CT, MA, TX, CA, FL, CO, DC)

Instacart direct: CA, IL, FL, TX

We would still need to align on their key retailers but if you need that, per the states I would suggest Kroger, ABS, Total Wine, Wal-Mart, Specs, Goody Goody, Bev Mo, ABC fine wine & Spirits, Binny's Liquors, Publix's.","Diageo Tailgating","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","48654400","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-04-28 19:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","INTEGRATION","Perfect-Rocket","2025-03-03 10:14","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","INTEGRATION","Perfect-Rocket","","40SIPC7","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:41:22","","","",""

Campaign Background: 

Nonni’s Bakery is the leader in the biscotti category, with current business established against two main lines under the Nonni's brand: “long stick” Biscotti (10+ flavors) and THINaddictives (6+ flavors). This campaign will focus on THINaddictives. The Nonni’s brand has undergone a recent revitalization, creating new positioning and way of expression intended to capture the minds and hearts of consumers. New packaging, messaging and roll-out of the rebrand across all consumer touchpoints will phase-in starting in July 2023. 

Marketing Objective:
Accelerate HH Penetration:
–Drive trial and conversion among category consumers for cookies and BFY snacks and switch competitive buyers as part of trial conversion
–Increase buy rate among current buyers and regain lapsed brand buyers
–Foster affinity through community of brand advocates

Brand/Product: 
Nonni’s ThinAddictives 
Existing - 8 fruit and nut flavors (6 in Grocery - 6 packs of 3 cookies) 

Retailers: 
Publix, Ahold (Stop & Shop, Giant, Giant Landover), Albertson’s (NorCal and SoCal, Jewel, ACME), Wakefern, Walmart (2 SKUs only in 500 locations), HEB.
*Retailers for the study are TBD since they are measuring several. I am recommending Publix & Albertsons but waiting on them to see what they would like the third retailer to be.","Nonni's ThinAddictives '23","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","11609345","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","2024-09-25 15:08","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Hunter Parker","","7FDZRL0","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:40:58","","","",""

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Blue Diamond Almond Flour campaign.  Looking for your recommendation on doing either food channel read or individual read for ABSCO, and two ADUSA banners out of Food Lion, Stop and Shop and Hannaford. Other retailers to consider to help with ROAS if you have data access: Hyvee, Giant Eagle, Lowes Foods, Raleys & potentially Weis.

Parent Company: Blue Diamond
Brand/Products: Hero - Blue Diamond Almond Flour
possibly rest of Blue Diamond portfolio as Halo if we think it is relevant (snack nuts, nut-thins and almond milk are a stretch to flour)
Timing: 11/1/23 - 12/25/23
Budget: $90K
Impressions: 8,571,429
Retailers: food channel or individual read for ABSCO, and two ADUSA banners out of Food Lion, Stop and Shop and Hannaford

If they are not able to pass along data - would you reco xAOC based on our retailers? or any other way of measuring this?

If they are able to pass along data - is this campaign feasible and do you foresee any issues with reaching ROI based on the below:

inMarket's main objective for this campaign will actually be driving ecommerce sales, and all audience impressions will go to an instacart landing page. However, the client would also like us to see if we can measure Secondary sales lift in store. We want to get pathformances POV based on the brand and states will be running in, if we should do a convenience read or a grocery read to see if there is lift. Key accounts for the client also include Walmart & Kroger (which are harder to measure) as well as Total Wine & More, so we could explore measuring TWM, or are open to Pathformance's recommendation here. Net-Net, we would love your POV on what may look best for measurement here. thank you!!

This is a duplicate of the previous request (misspelled my email in the first). Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Remy Martin Botanist Gin campaign. Looking to understand feasibility if we allocated $20K to media (low investment and below $50K but test would not be included as added value) and can focus on just a few markets since this is a lower investment.

Parent Company: Remy Martin 
Brand/Products: All The Botanist Gin products
Timing: 7/1/23 - 7/31/23 (no exact timing yet but about 4 weeks)
Budget: $20k

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Dash and Le Sueur campaigns. These would be two separate campaigns for the two products, but it would be the same recipe targeting, geo and retailer, so we were wondering if each were $25K, could we can test both campaigns? Or would you suggest a different budget like $30K each? If we can only test one campaign, which one would you recommend?

Of those, I believe Pathformance has access to three of the four retailers' sales data, at least at a regional level.

1) Based on this, could we partner with Pathformance to measure sales lift for these three retailers for King's Hawaiian? 
2) Is there another way to look at it such as a combination of the three retailers, or a total grocery channel read that would include all four in their overlapped markets?

                        Ben's Original portfolio
Timing: 7/24/23 - 9/9/23
Budget: $50K
Impressions: 6,060,606
Retailers: ADUSA
             Giant Food - Maryland (roughly 165 stores will be set with 
                               all 4 Bens 10 items on May 30)
             Hannaford - Northeast, roughly 185 stores will also be set 
                               with 4 Bens 10 items on May 30.
Measurement Type: Test vs. Control
*We would like to understand if we can still report back on the sales we moved for the new UPCs during the campaign and then report back inc sales/lift on existing Ben's Original UPCs. If this set up works, can you let us know feasibility for $50K (6MM impressions) but also if there's a larger budget that could still produce a positive ROAS at this retailer?*

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Quorn campaign. We would love a recommendation on budget for each flight to achieve positive ROAS.

Parent Company: Quorn
Brand/Products: Quorn
Timing: We are running 4 flights throughout 2023, and we'd be looking to measure one or both of the last two flights (8/15 - 9/30, 10/15 - 11/30)
Budget: TBD - right now, we have $20K allocated per flight, but we would hope to get them to $50K minimum total ($25K per flight) - ideally higher if positive ROAS can be achieved. Is $50K/flight feasible?
Impressions: TBD based on recommendation
Retailers: ABSCO, Whole Foods, Publix, Meijer and prioritizing 5 DMAs (NYC, LA, San Fran, ATL, Chicago)

Even mid-day Weds would still work. 

All 3 RFPs have media run dates Sept 1- Oct 15. We would like your help in recommending budgets for each RFP. Their goals are $1.50 ROAS and predicted CPUM $1.66. (""Cost Per Unit Moved"", which the agency indicates loosely translates to Budget/ Predicted Units Sold). 

The retail groups are:
RFP 1: Kroger and ABSCO
RFP: 2 Target and Walmart
RFP 3: Dollar General
- What budgets would you recommend for each retailer group to achieve $1.50 ROAS? 
- Are you able to measure units sold during Halloween?
- Are you able to determine how many units were sold to date?","Kinder Joy Halloween","","0.0","","Closed Lost","","","","","","","Drive Sales","","15000000","1.0","true","false","true","0.0","","","2025-04-29 17:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","2024-05-23 15:27","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Deactivated user","","F8GVMBP","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","2088:37:16","","","",""

I sent an email with a question pertaining to your capabilities: 
        ---Are we able to conduct a c-store channel read with test markets in the South Atlantic region?
        ----Is it possible to have two test regions within to A/B test running CTV ads?
If this is possible, we will most likely include CTV on the plan.

Here are the two plan options:

Plan Option 1:
$750K
Units: CTV, Video, Display & DOOH
Impressions: 64.2MM 

Plan Option 2:
$750K
Units: Video, Display & DOOH
Impressions: 70.6MM 

C-Stores are TBD, can you measure DOOH? Do you need impression break outs per unit?

Flight 2: Same brands for KC and Reckitt; Kraft Heinz brands are Kool-Aid Jammers/Pouches, Capri Sun, Kraft Mac & Cheese, and Oscar Meyer Lunchables.
Both flights will drive traffic to mPerks for users to redeem the savings offer. Because there is different targeting for each we are assuming two studies are needed.

Lately we have seen unique performance from the Lysol Laundry Sanitizer product, as consumers tend to keep coming back for it & the repeat purchase behavior we’ve seen is very high. Therefore, the main objective of this campaign is to drive trial & awareness around LLS, trying to get the consumer to try the product, with the hopes that afterwards they’ll continue to keep coming back for it!  We have two Digital Programs (1 LLS specific offer) during this campaign timeline, for your reference here:
 
-$1.50/1 LLS – live 5.21-6.3
-$0.50/1 Any Lysol – 6.4-6.17 (Also Reckitt may add an extra LLS offer into a 6.18-7.1 timeframe too still pending confirmation but checking with client)
 
As part of the National campaign the brand is offering a “try it, like it, or your money back”.  The shopper has to visit a website to complete the refund request as well - https://lysollaundrychallenge.com/ If you haven’t tried it yet we welcome you to try the challenge too!
 
URL Confirmation: The links are going to Lysol Laundry Sanitizer – Reckitt requesting to feature the 41 oz in our materials also.

As you're reviewing this one and the LBP which would also be new. Could you send over a rough estimate of how many of these stores will need to be dark from a media perspective? I'm a little concerned about the impact a very limited T/C list will have on delivering against internally. Sometimes, the Ansa T/C lists are pretty restrictive so we would also want to keep that in mind if these will be more restrictive since whole geos will need to be dark.

Let me know if you want to chat through any of these after you've had a chance to do some digging on your side.

Thank you both!","Dove Therapeutics","","0.3","","Response Sent","","","","10000.0","","","Drive Sales","","144928.0","0.0","false","false","false","1.0","","","2025-05-28 11:28","","","","","144:47:16","","","","","","","","","","51:28:40","","Offline Sources","INTEGRATION","Perfect-Rocket","2025-03-03 10:27","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","","Offline Sources","INTEGRATION","Perfect-Rocket","","77NB4DG","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","1892:18:11","","","3000.0","3000.0"

This one is a little different in the fact that this campaign will have 2 creatives with the first one being extremely important. Seasonal Soft Soap skus will only be in store 4/1-4/30. They will NOT be on shelf but only on a 4 way. After the seasonal pulse in April, we will continue to support body wash through May.

Seasonal Creative  – 4/1 – 4/30
We will feature seasonal soft soap scents. WE HAVE TO SELL THROUGH THESE OR THEY GO ON ROLL BACK!!
This pulse is a priority and should have more budget than pulse 2
Body Wash Creative – 5/1 -5/30
We will feature body wash skus (seasonality is NOT a thing here). 
We are wanting to drive penetration and awareness of body wash but there is no threat of rollbacks.","Softsoap Seasonals WMT","","0.3","","Response Sent","","","","6500.0","","","Drive Sales","","8333333.0","0.0","false","false","false","1.0","2025-03-21 18:52","2025-03-21 18:52","2025-05-21 18:37","","","","","144:47:45","","","","","","","","","","51:28:08","","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","2024-05-10 12:31","","","","","","","","","1.0","0.0","5.0","3.0","Offline Sources","EXTENSION","Jesse Isserow","","3O73DC6","PathX Projects","","Integration","Perfect-Rocket","","","","","","1892:17:41","","","1950.0","1950.0"

- The product being advertised for these two campaigns is their beer ""Flight"". Product SKUs can be provided as follow up
- Campaigns will run in Texas only
- Due to the hyperlocal nature of campaign set up- we have a predefined list of DMAs and zips in Texas where we will have media live, and therefore where we can draw a test group from. I can share this list as part of our follow up. 
- We require DMA level reporting
- Campaign objective is to garner awareness of ""Flight"" product and Yuengling brand 

Questions from me: 
- Are you able to set up a sales lift measurement study with the above geo restrictions? If so, which retailer provides the best coverage. We are open to suggestions here as long as we are able to also report on lift results at a DMA level.
- Are you able to provide reporting of results at a DMA level? and at what cadence across the campaign? 
- Pricing: Based on historical conversations this has been est. 8% of the media budget with a cap at $200k.

We know the typical requirement is 4 weeks, but we are working on a shorter promotional push and want to see if there is leeway to reduce this to 2 weeks, as we will have a solid amount of media weighting.

The campaigns will run from 3/26 – 4/09. Below is the breakout per retailer:
Walmart: $200K | 22.6MM impressions
Target: $200K | 19.9MM impressions

Looking to confirm feasibility for the below Campbell's Pepperidge Farm campaign. Can you please confirm if it's possible to measure Publix, Meijer, and 3 Ahold banners in a single study? If so, can you please let me know the amount of impressions you recommend for Ahold measurement? The current numbers are just our starting point and are somewhat arbitrary.

Parent Company: Campbell's 
Brand/Products: Pepperidge Farm: TBD (Swirl bread is the brand we're supporting)
Timing: 4/17/2023 - 5/15/2023
Budget: $135K, $150K, $200K
Impressions: Publix - 6,060,606 imps; Meijer - 4,242,424 imps; Ahold: Stop & Shop, Giant, and GIANT/MARTIN'S - 6,060,606 imps (evenly distributed; 2,020,202 imps for each banner)
Total Impressions: 16,363,636
Retailers: Publix, Meijer, and Ahold (Stop & Shop, Giant, & GIANT/MARTIN'S)

This is a unique one so happy to hop on a quick call to discuss. BabyBel is launching new flavors (Monterey Jack and Mozzarella). They are supporting Walmart and Albertsons but Bel Brands is very specific about retailer budgets and requested that each retailer have their own specific budget, IO, reporting, etc. The budget for the Albertsons campaign is ($73,889 and 9,236,098 impressions) and the budget for Walmart is ($29556 and 3,694,439 impressions). I'm assuming we'd only be able to run a lite SLS for Albertsons but wanted to double check.

This campaign is already live - executing in the Seattle market only. Since ABSCO is measured at the divisional level, we'd love if we could retroactively set up this test with Seattle division as test market and any other divisions as control. 

This would be a 'light' read only.

Please CC jenna@chicory.co, kmeyer@chicory.co and emily@chicory.co on your response.

Thanks so much!
